# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Refokus-Clone
This is a personal learning project: a clone of the original Refokus website (prior to its recent update). The aim was to closely replicate the website's UI and experience for educational purposes. All design, content, and original concept belong to Refokus.
About the Project
This clone was built to practice and enhance my skills in:

React for building UI components.

Tailwind CSS for efficient styling.

Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions.

Locomotive-Scroll (for smooth scrolling effects)

Props for structured data transfer between components.

Well-planned transitions and hover effects for interactive UI.

Scroll-based animations to mimic the dynamic effects of the original site.

The project pays close attention to micro-interactions and layout precision, resulting in a highly accurate reproduction of the earlier Refokus website.

Note: This is not intended for commercial use. All rights to the original design and content are owned by Refokus.
